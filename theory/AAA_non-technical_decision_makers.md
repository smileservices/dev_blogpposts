# Non-technical persons taking technical decisions

So, you have a great business idea based on exceptional market insights, but implementing it requires some kind of software application. That's great, but here lies the billion dollar question: how can you make decisions on your idea implementation if you don't have deep knowledge about software limits, capabilities and development? 

Should you start with building an internal software team, or would it be better to outsource or near-shore the development?

Will your application run on the web, will it be an executable running on customer's office server, will it be a mobile app?

Who should be responsible for the software architecture? How can you tell, as a non-technical person, whether the advised architecture and the technologies are indeed the best options for your project?

# Importance of addressing these topics as early as possible
Not to add to the pressure, but the answers to these questions will have consequences impacting all time-ranges. Key decisions taken at the start of the development of your software will make or break your business plan implementation. As the software automation is the backbone of your business, 

A simplistic depiction of the impact of important decisions on the duration of your business is like this:

At the worst end, it will make implementing your project impossible. Costs of the software project grow exponentially with the business development and operations.You can end up with a product that consumes more that it produces, resulting in business failure.
Moderately bad technical decisions will make your project more difficult to manage, will add higher running costs on it, will make raise costs in attracting talent. Costs graph compared to business operation would be logarithmical.
Re-building a project is more demanding than creating a completely new one. The more it gets changed/added to the initial project, the more difficult will be to re-build it or to fix it.
At the better end, good enough decisions will keep the costs in a liniar proportion to the business growth.
At the best end, your software project costs will scale liniarly but with a lower order. The backbone of your business will consume a very low amount of resources for operating, updating, monitoring, using.

So, yeah, these decisions are the make or break ones.

# How to make good decisions

1. **Become a software architecture engineer yourself**
It's a difficult and lengthy process. One can read about it but is best learned by gaining experience in various software projects and solving many problem types. An impractical solution

2. **Hire a consultant** 
While it may seem easy, judging who to work with is anothor chapter in itself. Not any self-entitled *software architect* can offer you the best options. Some may even be selling solutions not tailored to your unique set of problems. Some may just provide a generic solution built on their own software skills and tools.
