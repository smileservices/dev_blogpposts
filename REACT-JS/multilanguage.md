# Multilanguage support with ReactJS and Django

https://medium.com/@ricklee_10931/react-multi-lingual-with-react-i18next-57879f986168

## Approaches
1. Load the translations into the .js files and let reactJs manage it

2. Manage translations with django and serve them as a json obj in the base.html
use django javascript_catalog that supplies the same functions for dealing with translations
